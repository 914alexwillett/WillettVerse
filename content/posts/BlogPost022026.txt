The Glory Rolls On

@1:21AM
started messing with paginate again...

@2:18AM
I tried to paginate optio, which didn't pan out exactly like I wanted it to. The problem I think is the nuances in the file pathing. I want to keep the main page essentially looking like it has been, but I want to have the next page when loaded to be styled in the paginate style. 

I think the main problem is my lack of understanding how html works when loading multiple pages. This requires more learning. Also I would need to rebuild the site from the ground up adding each bit piece by piece until I figured out what went wrong. As for now I still have a functioning site that works for me, so who cares.

Next is trying to set up git, it always feels cool when I use bash in the terminal. If I get the GitHub setup I can actually play around with version control instead of the jank-ass copy file strategy I usually use. It does work, but I think it could be better.

When trying the harder way generating a encrypted key for GitHub, this was generated. 

"""
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:+EDl9zfgawQx7TOc8bGL6cyIP2cAx2pPIM+Gpr26bwE 914alexwillett@gmail.com
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ED25519 256]--+
|        . o.     |
|       o   oo .  |
|      . ..oo.+ o |
|    E...o.o+*.o  |
|     .o=S=  +=o. |

Which I thought looked cool. Terminal ASCII aesthetic still really appeals to me. I feel like a hacker and I like its elegant simplicity.

Using ChatGPT is actually insanely useful. Like insanely helpful. I have a personal tutor that explains, every step thats holding me back I can just ask for clarification.

Next I connected my GitHub to my Vercel and then deployed!

Let's fucking go! 

I still need to workout the workflow, but I think I can manage things for now. I will probably still mostly mess around remotely and add commits (<- probably not using that phrase correctly) occasionally or when I am done with a session. Either way I am so psyched. 

I will probably coast for a little bit for now, but maybe I'll have more dialogue with Gippity later about the app. Maybe I'll do more of the react tutorial. Maybe I'll jerk it and fall asleep. Regardless I've made progress today and I am thankful for that.

Now that it is LIVE I am looking at the http paths (also probably saying that wrong) and it feels like whenever I click on a link to the home page, it simply directs me to whichever .txt file I've been using, much like if I had a JPEG of a dog and the link I clicked directed me there. This isn't ideal. This is probably where I am getting into trouble. Maybe if I learn react I can upgrade the whole setup because it seems like the complexity of using a simple HTML + CSS + JS setup grows exponentially, the more features I want to add. That being said I still like the idea of keeping it bare bones as a tool for learning and a point of eloquent craftsmanship, but we will see.

Also I'm trying to watch accepted on my phone in the background.

@4:03AM
This is where I will end for the night. Peace out y'all.
