The Glory Rolls On

started messing with paginate again...

I tried to paginate optio, which didn't pan out exactly like I wanted it to. The problem I think is the nuances in the file pathing. I want to keep the main page essentially looking like it has been, but I want to have the next page when loaded to be styled in the paginate style. 

I think the main problem is my lack of understanding how html works when loading multiple pages. This requires more learning. Also I would need to rebuild the site from the ground up adding each bit piece by piece until I figured out what went wrong. As for now I still have a functioning site that works for me, so who cares.

Next is trying to set up git, it always feels cool when I use bash in the terminal. If I get the GitHub setup I can actually play around with version control instead of the jank-ass copy file strategy I usually use. It does work, but I think it could be better.

When trying the harder way generating a encrypted key for GitHub, this was generated.

The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:+EDl9zfgawQx7TOc8bGL6cyIP2cAx2pPIM+Gpr26bwE 914alexwillett@gmail.com
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ED25519 256]--+

|       o   oo .  |

Which I thought looked cool. Terminal ASCII aesthetic still really appeals to me. I feel like a hacker and I like its elegant simplicity.

Using ChatGPT is actually insanely useful. Like insanely helpful. I have a personal tutor that explains, every step thats holding me back I can just ask for clarification.
