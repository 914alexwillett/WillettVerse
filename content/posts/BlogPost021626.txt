Economic Learning App Part 2

I voiced to the App my concerns for non-linearity and trying to ground things more in statistics over saying X causes Y. It stimulated an interesting point of framing things in terms of economic regimes as opposed to hard and fast rules that stay static. 

"""
Markets are conditional Systems, inflation rising does NOT mean `Stocks Down.` 
It means: 
- `Stocks down IF liquidity is tightening`
- `Stocks go up IF growth is accelerating faster than inflation`
- `Neutral IF inflation is already priced`
"""

Another interesting response was:
"""
Correlation is not a truth detector.
It’s a state detector. Instead of `Correlation between CPI and SPX since 1990,` you want:

-Rolling 6m correlation

-Rolling 12m correlation

-Correlation segmented by inflation regime

-Correlation segmented by liquidity regime

 Because relationships change.
"""

It claims that my app is becoming a macro systems laboratory. So it's not a basic dashboard, it's not a trading tool. Instead we're looking at aspects like conditional relationships, structural shifts, interaction effects, variance drivers.

It warned my about the short comings of using ANOVA and Correlation with such a small sample size, history only happened once (that we are aware of). To auto generate regimes, rather than me manually coming up with them. This would use K-means clusters of various data points. 

K-means clustering as a refresher takes multiple variables, groups time periods on similarity, and finds clusters of macro conditions. "The algorithm says: These periods are statistically similar across variables."

For the last portion of this session, I manually copied a prototype of the Marco-Lab app that OpenAI spun up. I don't really know React very well so that may be my next step on the learning journey. At some point I should cicle around back to my blog, but I want to get a better feel for my workflow when it comes to making blog posts. I really like the looseness and minimalist feel of typing in the notes app.
Maybe using markdown and then converting them into posts is not needed. This is probably all for now. I have to start my day soon as it is Monday.
