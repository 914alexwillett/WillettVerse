The endless parking lot smelled like piss and grass clippings. I notice a subtle glimmer of heat on the horizon. My mind still groggy and only partially thawed. On foot it’s an hour round trip. Every time it sucks, every day it has to be done. I feel self conscious all of a sudden, like someone is watching me. That’s just the anxiety talking. I shake my head like a wet dog to shoo away the thought and turn my attention to what I am going to get at the liquor store. I walk past two black teens in hoodies. 

Am I too lazy to cook today? Should I stop by McFoods’? If I do cook it’s not even cooking, it’s just fucking warming up chicken filets on a pan and boiling rice in a bag. The route behind Trendy Organic Grocer is the quickest way there, but there's hardly any shade. The heat makes me feel even more dehydrated. I get anxious again. Shit, has it really gotten that bad? My hands tremble slightly and I start to sweat a little bit, it’s probably just the heat. 

Fast approaching footsteps stomp behind me to my right. I feel a hand on my left shoulder, then something sharp rips through my lower jaw. Did he just say some bullshit in Latin? I spastically jerk away and immediately I feel cold. My legs give out and my head bounces on the concrete, it doesn’t hurt though. My whole world turns into Static TV. 

I try to get to my feet, but everything feels heavy. A skinny white dude is sprinting away, all I can see is blonde dreadlocks flapping into the distance. I see an ornate letter opener on the sidewalk and a puddle of my own blood beginning to flow towards the storm drain. 

Let me just sit down for a second and collect myself. Maybe just lie down actually. Black.

==================
Chapter 1:
==================
Sophie had never even seen a fight in real life before. When she saw the blonde guy with dreads run up to the victim, at first she thought they were buddies. It was nearly an out of body experience seeing his throat get slit. Instantly it became another episode of CrimeShow season one hundred and thirty whatever. Fake neon red blood pooled and ran into the street. The stage lighting was overly bright and cheesy. The actors’ performances were very convincing, however. The victim looked so lifeless and full of confusion. 

There was no one assigned to come back and clean up the murder scene after the investigation was finished. Also it hadn’t even rained in what seemed like a month. It might be a drought, but it’s hard to tell these days. Every trip to Convenience/Store was another grim reminder of what she saw that day. Another fresh coat of paint to the gruesome mural graffitied to the back of Sophie’s eyelids.

She crossed the street to not walk on the stain. The police officer who took her account of the incident was a total asshole. His tone was unnecessarily skeptical and hostile. The cops eyes looked dark and tired, he smelled vaguely of cheeseburger and tiny bottles of vodka. His gaze slowly gravitated towards her nipples poking out of her thin shirt the whole interview, she just wanted to go to get some food and back, she wasn’t expecting to interact with anyone that day. She answered the best she could, but she was still a bit disassociated by the time the cops cleared the area and began grilling potential witnesses.

She could have just as easily walked away and not been involved in it at all, but something kept her lingering around to see how everything would play out. Walking down the sidewalk, she noticed something in the bushes in the apartment complex to her right. It looked like an old beat up workbook. 

Checking to see if no one would see her being a weirdo, she had to crawl on her knees a little into the bush just to reach for the book. It turned out to be a journal. It felt a little damp. It had no title, just dates and entries. Stats and numbers written down that had no immediately apparent meaning.

According to StrangeCoin, the kickoff event is happening soon. I can’t wait. I need to pack my bug out bag. Time_machine_gecko is going to eat so much shit when it happens. Sovereign bonds just dropped to SOME%. 3 separate banks were denied repo yesterday. 

It would be cool to solve the next clue. The poster who solved the last one is even stumped. I don’t even know what I would do with all that money. I feel guilty about RIPMia77.

What the fuck is taking so long? I really don’t know how much longer I can keep my position open. I’m already balls deep in the red. Is StrangeCoin wrong?

Sophie immediately closed the notebook and clumsily stuffed it into her backpack. This was obviously dread-head’s. This is her taking evidence from a crime scene, a felony that could totally fuck up the trajectory of her life. 

She continued on her way to Convenience/Store trying to act as normal as she could, which apparently is more difficult than one would expect. Usually when she’s nervous she completely loses her appetite, oddly she was even hungrier than when she left her apartment at The Green Estates.

The cashier behind the counter was cute, but was obviously a total fuckboy. His face looked almost identical to the protagonist of her favorite Manga as a kid. Sophie remembers having a large lecture style class with him. It wasn’t that he was outwardly rude, but his clothes and body language gave off an heir of too good and too rich to be bothered to act like a decent human. Seeing him working here painted him in a very different light. It turned him into a puzzle that she wanted to solve. 

Sophie grabbed her canned espresso and another box of these weird protein bars that were popular in Eurasia that she had recently been obsessed with. It had a salty peanut buttery taste that was subtle enough for her to want to eat a thousand and not get sick of them. At the counter she also got two meat patties. That was just for the trip back home. 

She considered getting a pack of cigarettes but decided against it. She had occasionally smoked, mostly to be social. It felt good when she was either drunk or on amphet, but smoking made her feel heavy and lethargic when sober. She gave the cashier the sneakiest of glances and went on her way. 

Just as she turns away the fuck boyo says, “I know you from somewhere?” Halfway between a question and a statement. Sophie heard him, but was already out the door. The notebook was burning nuclear hot in her backpack. No work was going to get done tonight. Fuck her theory of government paper, she usually does it last minute anyway. 

Lost in thought, she teleports back into her apartment building. “The Green Estates” written in massive golden cursive letters. Ironically, the only greenery this complex had were a few shitty bushes on each side of the building’s front entrance. Wispier and more sparse than a 15 year old boy’s upper lip. 

Waiting in the lobby felt like purgatory, the left elevator opened and two students looking like they were headed off to the bars rolled out laughing and trying to grab each other's asses. Lovely.

She never took the left elevator, it was too janky. She knew it would be fine, it successfully ran all day everyday, but the bumps and the little jerk up to each floor when the doors opened were too unsettling. The right elevator was taking too long. 

She opted for the stairs. The stairs always smelled of freshly smoked marijuana, which was comforting. Being a partaker herself, it always gave her piece of mind that no one in the building actually gave a fuck what anyone was else was up to short of murder. Which due to recent events, was not to be taken for granted.  

The apartment door was unlocked which was always assumed. On the couch was her roommate Teddy and his girlfriend Mauve. She didn’t really hate Mauve, but Sophie always joked to herself that her parents were trying to name her Maeve, but fumbled the birth certificate. No that was too charitable of a take, Mauve was very much intentional. 

One second thought, Mauve was actually really an apt name for her, she was dull and pretty with purple undertones. “Sophie, did you hear about the murder by the Abodes?” Mauve chirped from the couch. “Oh my god, isn’t that so scary? What’s wrong with people nowadays? I walk by there all the time to go to PubSalad. That could have been me. That could have been you! I’m not sure I feel safe walking around campus anymore. Teddy! You have to walk me home tonight. Maybe even stay over to protect me.”

Teddy barely peeked his head up from the couch, he gave Sophie a warm smile and nonchalant salute, then took a hearty rip from his bong and tapped the ash from the bowl onto the coffee table. 

How did she find time to breath doing all that talking? Sophie replied, “Yeah, it’s pretty crazy stuff. I know you heard about that guy who held up his professor at gun point in that Nondenominational Religious University in the south. What was the college’s name again?” 

“I know Sophie, I can’t even believe in humanity anymore, doesn’t it just make you sick? I saw a video last night about…” “I gotta go Mauve, it was nice seeing you though. Sorry I just have this Calc module due by 12:00am tonight and I’m kinda tired.” Sophie trailed off while sliding into her room, slowly shutting the door behind her.
